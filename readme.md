# Canvas AI: Draw & Learn

## Project Description

Canvas AI is a unique project that combines the intuitiveness of drawing with the power of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional tools that rely on text or numerical input, Canvas AI allows you to *draw* your problems or ideas, and then uses AI to analyze your drawing and provide relevant information or solutions.

Think of it as a super-powered visual calculator and information tool! Here are a few examples of what you can do:

* **Math Problems:** Draw a visual representation of a math problem (e.g., a diagram of a shape with dimensions), and Canvas AI can calculate parameters like area, volume, or solve equations.
* **Anatomy & Biology:** Draw a diagram of a biological system (e.g., the human respiratory system), and Canvas AI can identify and label specific parts.
* **Physics & Engineering:** Sketch a mechanical system or structure, and Canvas AI can help analyze forces, calculate measurements, or explain concepts.
* **Anything Visual:** The possibilities are endless! You can draw a rough sketch of virtually anything and have AI attempt to make sense of it, providing explanations, definitions, or related information.

## Features

* **Interactive Canvas:** A user-friendly canvas interface for drawing your queries.
* **AI-Powered Analysis:** Integration with a powerful AI model to interpret and understand your drawings.
* **Dynamic Output:** Clear and concise text-based explanations or solutions generated by the AI.
* **Versatile Applications:** Applicable across various domains, including education, problem-solving, and creative exploration.

## How to Use

1.  **Draw on the Canvas:** Use your mouse or a stylus to draw your problem, diagram, or idea on the interactive canvas.
2.  **Submit for Analysis:** Once you've finished drawing, submit your creation for AI analysis.
3.  **Receive Output:** The AI will process your drawing and provide a short explanation, solution, or relevant information.
